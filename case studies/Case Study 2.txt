Big Bazzar is one the largest suppliers of consumer goods.  Big Bazzar wants to develop a Java application which could accept the orders placed by their customers and perform various operations on orders.  Implement the above scenario as per following guidelines.

Design a class called Order which has the following private instance variables. 
  orderId			int  
  customerName		String 
  orderAmount			float
  paymentOption	 	String

-	Define parameterized constructor to initialize all the above attributes
-	Perform the below validations and throw an user defined exception InvalidOrderException if any of the validations fail.
o	orderAmount should not be less than 100
o	paymentOption can be either “CoD” or “Gift Card” or “Internet Banking”

Design a class called OrderServiceUtil with the below methods.										            	  
•	To add an order for customer in TreeMap.
o	public void addOrder (Order o1) 

•	To search and return an Order object
o	public Order searchOrder (String orderId ) 

•	To compute and return the total amount of all the Order instance
o	public float findTotal() 

Store the above classes in the package com.store

Write a class TestClient in the package com.store.test with the main method to test the methods in the OrderServiceUtil class.
